# realTimeBusTrackerModule9
Real Time Bus Tracker exercise from Module 9

# Project Description: 
This project offers two features: 
- Shows the stops of the bus 
  - This map shows all the stops of the bus route between MIT and Harvard
  - The size of the marker is default but the color has been changed to blue color
- Move Bus  
  - There is another marker with black color but increased size placed at the starting stop - which is MIT. 
  - The button "Move bus between MIT and Harvard" is available at the top left of the page. 
  - When user clicks this button, the black marker will move across all the stops between MIT and Harvard.  

# How to run the project:
1. Download the files, 
2. Open the index.html in a browser window to execute this project. 
3. There is a button on top left of the page, and the information about this is provided in project description above. Use the buttons to execute the code.

# Future Improvements:
- The 'Move bus between MIT and Harvard' button - if this button is pressed multiple times when game is already in motion, it increases the speed of the bus move (the black marker moves faster)
- This can be enhanced further 
- Couple of ideas: 
  - Have a stop and pause button - this would provide an option to stop or pause the bus. 
  - When 'Move bus' button is clicked once and the stop is already moving, do not initiate the logic again. Add the logic to implement this functionality.
  - Disable the 'Move bus' button once game is in progress, so that the process is visible to the user that button is disabled due to game in progress .
